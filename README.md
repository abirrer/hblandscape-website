### Website

<p>https://hblandscape.herokuapp.com/</p>

### Technologies Used

### Key Features

<p>The homepage features a rotating background image carousel.  I did this using a setTimeout function which changes the background image src via this.setState.</p>

</p>

<p>The Contact Us page features a simple form for potential clients to send an email directly to my father's Gmail account. Since my dad operates a completely offline business, this form will allow him to get client emails directly to his phone where he can then call them immediately and have initial information to start the conversation.</p>

</p>

<p>Lastly, there is a section for client's to login or registration to view personal account details. Later clients will later be able to view their monthly invoices and submit payments via embedded PayPal button.</p>
